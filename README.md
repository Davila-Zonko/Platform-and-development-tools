This project demonstrates the practical implementation of the composite and observer design patterns using PHP. 
The composite pattern is used to model a hierarchical course structure where individual lessons and grouped modules are treated uniformly, while 
The observer pattern illustrates how multiple students can automatically receive notifications when a course update occurs.
The project is organized with a clean folder structure and a simple web interface to display outputs clearly, making the concepts easy to understand and visually appealing.
Through this implementation, the project highlights how design patterns improve code organisation, flexibility in real-world applications.
